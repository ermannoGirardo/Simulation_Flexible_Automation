This is the folder of the flexible automation assignment.
In this folder you can find:
	-Robotic_Arm.ttt: A model (not finished) of a arm robot, importing meshes, downloaded from GrabCad
			  and modified with CREO.
			  I have no much time to finished the model and implement it in the final scene.
	-Robotic_Arm_Pure_UI: A second model (more simple) has been developed. In this scene you can play
			      with the position of the joints via a user interface.
	-Industrial_Robot_Car_Pieces.ttt : It is the final scene of the project. The robot takes the objects
					   from an input conveyor, and via object recognition (RGB), the arm release
	 				   the current object on the proper conveyor.
					   !!!Before start the simulation verify that the simulation engine is set in Newton mode!!!
	-SimulationVideo.avi: It is the video of the simulation.
 
You can find all the files also in my GitRepository @
